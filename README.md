# dBASE.NET - Read and write DBF files with .NET

__dBASE.NET__ is a .NET class library used to read FoxBase, dBASE III and dBASE IV .dbf files. Data read
from a file is returned as a list of typed fields and a list of records. This library is useful to add
data import from dBASE sources to a .NET project.

This code has been tested against a number of dBASE files found in the wild, including FoxBase and dBASE III/IV
files with and without memo files. A .NET unit test project is part of this repository and new test files
may be added to it over time.

There is [an article describing the dBASE file format](http://www.independent-software.com/dbase-dbf-dbt-file-format.html).

## Installing dBASE.NET

dBASE.NET is available from [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dBASE.NET/):

* Package manager:

```
PM> Install-Package dBASE.NET -Version 1.2.1
```

* .NET CLI:

```
> dotnet add package dBASE.NET --version 1.2.1
```
   
* Paket CLI:

```
> paket add dBASE.NET --version 1.2.1
```

## Opening a DBF file

```c#
using dBASE.NET;

dbf.Read("database.dbf");
```

This returns an instance of the `Dbf` class. With this, you can iterate over fields found in the table:

```c#
foreach(DbfField field in dbf.Fields) {
	Console.WriteLine(field.Name);
}
```

You can also iterate over records:

```c#
foreach(DbfRecord record in dbf.Records) {
	for(int i = 0;  i < dbf.Fields.Count; i++) {
		Console.WriteLine(record[i]);
	}
}
```

Count the records:

```c#
Console.WriteLine(dbf.Records.Count);
```

## Working with memo files

When memo file accompanying the `.dbf` file is found (either `.dbt` or `.fpt`), with the same base name as the table file, then 
dBASE.NET will load the memo file's contents. 

## Writing a DBF file

To write DBF data, you can either create a new instance of `Dbf`, then create fields and records, or load an existing table and modify its fields or records.

This sample code creates a new table with a single character field, then saves the .dbf file:

```c#
dbf = new Dbf();
DbfField field = new DbfField("TEST", DbfFieldType.Character, 12);
dbf.Fields.Add(field);
DbfRecord record = dbf.CreateRecord();
record.Data[0] = "HELLO";
dbf.Write("test.dbf", DbfVersion.VisualFoxPro);
```

## Supported Field types

| Code | Field type   | .NET counterpart |
|:-----|:-------------|:-----------------|
| `C`  | Character string | String |
| `D`  | Date             | DateTime |
| `I`  | Integer          | Int32 |
| `L`  | Logical          | Bool |
| `M`  | Memo             | String |
| `N`  | Numeric          | Double |
| `T`  | DateTime         | DateTime |
| `Y`  | Currency         | Float |
